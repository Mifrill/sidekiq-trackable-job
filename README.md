# Sidekiq::Trackable::Job

Unified solution aimed at improving monitoring and failover with TrackableJob for Sidekiq and a corresponding trackable_jobs table.

Approach outline:

When we queue one of the TrackableJobs, it inserts a record into trackable_jobs table before queuing job to the Sidekiq.
This record stores job class and model_id parameter.
That way we track when job starts and can restart them all in case of a failure, even if our Sidekiq is completely missing.
No jobs will be forgotten. trackable_jobs also has a created_at timestamp to monitor lags.

Once TrackableJob has been processed, it removes corresponding record from the trackable_jobs. 
I.e. when all jobs has been processed successfully, we have 0 trackable jobs in this table. And thatâ€™s a healthy state.

TrackableJob has a convenient method to restart all or some jobs (by ids) from this table.
That way we can easily restart jobs which, for example, were started 3 days ago and failed to complete.
